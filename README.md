# QUIZ APP

# A simple interactive Quiz App built with React. It dynamically fetches questions from an external API, shuffles answer options, and lets users attempt multiple-choice questions one by one. The app highlights correct and wrong answers, tracks the score in real-time, and shows the final result at the end. It also includes a reset feature to restart the quiz without refreshing the page.
